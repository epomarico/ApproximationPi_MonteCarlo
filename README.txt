This folder "ApproximationPi_MonteCarlo" contains files for the implementation of a Monte Carlo simulation to find an approximate value of pi.

- ApproximationPi_MonteCarlo.m: Matlab code to launch the Monte Carlo simulation and test its convergence
- approximation_pi.m: function that implements the Monte Carlo simulation
- plot_example.m: function to plot a for various number of draws
